# docker-django-htmx

This is a small repo of examples of Django with HTMX that I have cobbled together from the community so that you can quickly explore strategies.

This accompanies my article on Medium on the topic.

## How to run

Easiest and recommended way is to run with:

docker compose up

Then navigate to:

localhost:8000

and browse different example apps using the navigation bar.
